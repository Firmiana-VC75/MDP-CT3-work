                <h2>Idea</h2>
                <p>The definition of a Goldberg machine reminds me of the contraptions I saw in Tom and Jerry cartoons as a child.
                    I want to create an art-related website where viewers can learn about paintings.
                    At the same time, I also want to infuse the site with some fun elements.
                </p>

                <p>I want to randomly display famous paintings using the Metropolitan Museum of Art's API.
                    Afterward, the color analyzer will work to extract the primary colors from the painting.

                <h2>Coding Process</h2>
                <p>The first issue I encountered while coding was with the API.
                    Initially, I found a link on Met's open-source website.
                    But when I copied it into my code, the webpage kept displaying error.
                </p>
                <img src="images/4.webp" alt="Problem 1">

                <p>I verified the API link three times to ensure it was correct,
                    only to discover the error stemmed from my incorrect use of quotation marks.
                    The proper method is to use backticks.But a new problem has arisen. </p>
                <img src="images/1.png" alt="Problem 2">
                <p>The webpage still displays “Undefined.”</p>

                <h2>Random Function</h2>
                <p>I checked the JSON feedback.
                    In the JSON, I can see that information is being generated, but my webpage isn't receiving it.
                </p>

              <h2>Make the design more reasonable</h2>
              <p>Considering that VR glasses need to be worn, I made an indentation to accommodate the nose.
                Also put the knobs from the top to the side.</p>

            <p>I placed this device in a public setting. In my imagination, the glasses can be used at any time.</p>
